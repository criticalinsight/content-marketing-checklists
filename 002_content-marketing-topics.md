5. **Thesis, antithesis, synthesis:** (1) a beginning proposition called a thesis, (2) a negation of that thesis called the antithesis, and (3) a synthesis whereby the two conflicting ideas are reconciled to form a new proposition.
	* The thesis is an intellectual proposition.
	* The antithesis is a critical perspective on the thesis. (examples included)
	* The synthesis solves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis by reconciling their common truths, and forming a new proposition.
A thesis can be seen as a single idea. The idea contains a form of incompleteness that gives rise to the antithesis, a conflicting idea. A third point of view, a synthesis, arises from this conflict. It overcomes the conflict by reconciling the truths contained in the thesis and antithesis at a higher level. **Start writing with the antithesis, because the thesis doesn’t need to be explained. It’s a topic that everyone talks about**
