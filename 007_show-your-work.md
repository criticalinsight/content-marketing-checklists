	* Who do you follow online? 
	* Who are the practitioners you look up to in your field?

- [ ] **Add pictures:** they will increase the visibility of my posts

- [ ] **Tell good stories:** The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work effects how they value it.
	* The most important part of a story is its structure. A good story structure is tidy, sturdy, and logical: Most story structures can be traced back to myths and fairy tales. A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition (perhaps including his own doubts), and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw.
		* Once upon a time, there was _____. Every day, _____. One day, _____. Because of that, _____. Because of that, _____. Until finally, _____.” 
	* A Story consists of the following parts (Dan Harmon’s Story Circle):
		1. A character is in a zone of comfort
		2. But they want something
		3. They enter an unfamiliar situation
		4. Adapt to it
		5. Get what they wanted
		6. Pay a heavy price for it
		7. Return to their familiar situation
		8. Having changed
		
- [ ] **Just set a timer for 30 minutes.** Once the timer goes off, publish the story kick yourself off the Internet and get back to work.

- [ ] **Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?** Don’t post things online that you’re not ready for everyone in the world to see.  _**Don’t write about my position as a top manager**_

- [ ] Always be sure to run everything you share with others through **The “So What?” Test.** Don’t overthink it; just go with your gut.

- [ ] **Always attribute authors.** If you share the work of others, it’s your duty to make sure that the creators of that work get proper credit. Another form of attribution that we often neglect is where we found the work that we’re sharing. It’s always good practice to give a shout-out to the people who’ve helped you stumble onto good work.

- [ ] **Always keep your audience in mind.** Speak to them directly in plain language. Value their time. Be brief.


## Some other tips
- - - -

- [ ] **Go and buy a domain name.** Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. 

- [ ] **Build a good name.** Keep your name clean. Don’t make compromises. Don’t worry about making a bunch of money or being successful. Be concerned with doing good work.

- [ ] **We all love things that other people think are garbage.** You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage. Don’t try to be hip or cool. Being open and honest about what you like is the best way to connect with people who like those things, too.

- [ ] Once you make sharing part of your daily routine, you’ll notice themes and trends emerging in what you share. **You’ll find patterns in your flow.** When you detect these patterns, you can start gathering these bits and pieces and turn them into something bigger and more substantial. You can turn your flow into stock. For example, a lot of the ideas in this book 
1. started out as tweets, 
2. which then became blog posts, 
3. which then became book chapters. Small things, over time, can get big.
