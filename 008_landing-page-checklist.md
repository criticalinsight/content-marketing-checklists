Chapter 13: The Six Elements of VITO Correspondence
# Vito Rule #20: Every piece of VITO correspondence has six specific parts, each of which must stand on its own but also be logically connected to all the other parts.

### Element One: A Headline
This headline breaks VITO’s preoccupation and earns attention and readership. It’s short, to the point, and will not include words or phrases with which VITO is unfamiliar. The headline is short (less than thirty words), hard hitting, and attention grabbing.

### Element Two: A Tie-In Paragraph
This paragraph is designed to connect the headline to the rest of the correspondence; typically, it introduces some kind of social proof for the claim just made. Social proof is evidence of your track record with other VITOs in a similar or identical industry as the VITO you’re sending this correspondence to.

### Element Three: Benefit Bullets
This is a series of short statements of your abilities in the areas of greatest interest to this VITO. Whenever you are in doubt about what the areas of interest for a given VITO might be, just follow the priority list I’ve already shared with you as your default setting.

1. Increasing top-line revenues
2. Increasing the effectiveness of revenue-generating employees, mission-critical employees, and mission-critical processes
3. Cutting expenses
4. Becoming fully compliant with any and all government regulations or industry practices

### Element Four: An Ending Paragraph
This is where you state a call to action or introduce some level of suspicion as to what the possibilities could be. You could also invite VITO to engage certain Decision Makers—by name—in this paragraph.

### Element Five: An Action-Oriented Postscript
This is where you’ll put the precise day, date, and time that you’ll be calling VITO. In this postscript, you’ll include the name of VITO’s personal assistant.

### Element Six: A Short Handwritten Note
You will attach this to the back (not the front) of your correspondence.
It’s a note to VITO’s personal assistant. You know he or she’s going to be opening up all of VITO’s mail and reading this, right?

### My Favorite Headlines
The most powerful headlines are ones that will catch VITO’s attention and get VITO to think (or say aloud), “How did they do that?” or “I would love to talk with this genius.” Headlines can include a quote from your VITO, which should be easy to get, or one of your existing customer’s VITOs, which is almost as easy to get. 

* The world’s largest electronic manufacturer increased stock value and reduced time-to-market by [63] days while eliminating [$87.9 million in unnecessary inventory]. My team led the way in just [144] days.”
* Further increase shareholder wealth while at the same time achieving greater compliance—in just [144 days]. Here’s the team that helped do it.
_You’re not just sharing a story about increasing shareholder value; you’re sharing a story about increasing shareholder value while at the same time reducing time-to-market and eliminating unnecessary inventory costs._
**This is called a balanced gain equation, and it’s an extremely important part of any benefit you discuss with, or preview for, VITO.**

* “Further improve operational economics, compliance, and globalization capabilities, in just [90 days].”
* “Further improve shareholder wealth in the next [six months] by improving revenues while lowering expenses.”

* “One of the largest telecommunications companies in America has increased the efficiency and effectiveness of their employees while realizing an annual savings of over [$1,200,444]. How can my team
serve you?”

### My Favorite Tie-In Paragraphs
The best tie-in paragraphs are ones that keep the ball rolling and add a new thought for VITO to process. In some cases, this new thought can provide a segue into Element Three, your benefit bullets.
**WARNING: It’s very important not to repeat anything in your tie-in paragraph that you said in your headline. Repeated words, phrases, and ideas will turn VITO off.**

* “We’ve helped [cut time] and [expense] into extremely effective business tools while enhancing our customer’s ability to [concentrate on core competencies]. We’ve accomplished this in one or more of the following ways:”
* “During the past [12 years], we have worked with [29] [manufacturing companies] collectively, and we’ve been able to
[increase mar-gins and shareholder value]. Are any of the following achievements on your list of goals, plans, or objectives for the [first half] of this calendar [year]? If so, the good news is that we have created a proven, repeatable process that we guarantee to deliver results such as:” “While you peruse this correspondence, [12] other [CEOs] in your industry are benefiting from our innovations with [higher margins], [lower expenses], and [greater peace of mind]. Here are [two]
additional results we are providing our business partners:”

### My Favorite Benefit Bullets
The best benefit bullets are short and to the point. Here, again, be careful not to repeat anything. 

»» Reduction of annual variable cost by as much as $6.4 million without compromising patient care.
»» Up to 30 percent increase in patient billings while maintaining full compliance and fiduciary responsibilities.
»» Further improve clinical results including up to 54 percent decrease in hospital mortality.
»» Lowering inventory and improving product availability by detecting supply disruptions early and responding with cost- effectiveness in mind.
»» Increased revenues of up to [44 percent] per year have been reported by our clients.
»» Discovering and responding to trends that become visible with a deeper understanding of supplier, inventory, and shipment knowledge-based information.
»» Protect Market Share—Employee and client satisfaction & retention consistently adds up to better utilization of human assets. Consider what an employee turnover of only [8 per-cent] and customer churn of less than [14 percent] does for top, middle, and bottom-line numbers.
»» Greater add-on business potential while reducing expenses by as much as [$258,000] each month!
»» Our partnership improves return on assets by actually reducing the asset base while at the same time making the balance of this base perform to extreme levels of efficiency.
»» Faster product shipments by as much as [65 days]. Improved net working capital equals increased inventory turns and minimizes lost sales opportunities to competition.
»» Customer satisfaction is higher because the information they receive is more accurate, relevant, and timely.

### My Favorite Ending Paragraphs

The ending paragraph is where you want to make a clear call to action or introduce some level of doubt and suspicion about whether you can deliver these kinds of results for VITO, Inc. If you choose the latter option, you’ll be dialing into VITO’s powerful competitive nature, need to win, and desire not to miss out on anything!

* “[Ms. Importanta], the possibility for your company to achieve similar or even greater results is difficult to determine at this point.”
One fact is certain: You are the one person who can initiate the call to action, and together, our team of experts can quickly explore exactly what all the possibilities are.”
* “[Mr. Benefito], what does this have to do with your [financial institute]? Perhaps everything, if you determine that one or more of the results mentioned in this correspondence are relevant to your strategic initiatives for the balance of this [calendar year]. All that’s necessary is for you to consider taking my call.”
* “[Mr. Benefito], it’s obvious you know your institute’s challenges better than anyone does. But what may not be so obvious is how [YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE], the [world leader in business solutions], could help you realize similar or even greater results before the end of the [first half of this year]. If you would like to take the first step, our complete team of [business experts] can quickly determine each and every possibility.”

### My Favorite Action-Oriented Post Scripts

This is the shortest part of your correspondence, but it may well have the greatest impact. Why? You’re including VITO’s Personal Assistant in the conversation, and you’re also taking the initiative by suggesting a specific day, date, and time for your first conversation. Note that both of these steps are mandatory. I call VITO’s Personal Assistant by the gender-neutral name Tommie.

* “P.S. I’ll call your office on [Thursday, May 14, at 9:30 a.m.]. If this is an inconvenient time, please have [Tommie] inform me as to when I should make the call. Or, if you like, you can reach me [Monday or Tuesday between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.]. I look forward to our conversation.”
* “P.S. [Tommie], I’ll plan on calling your office on [Thursday, May 14, at 9:30 a.m.]. If this isn’t a convenient time to have a brief conversation with [Ms. Importanta]. Please call me and let me know.”
* “P.S. The topics of this letter may be important to both of our organizations. That’s why I’ll plan on calling your office on [Thursday,
May 14. at 9:30 a.m.]. If this is an inconvenient time, please have Tommie inform me as to when I should make the call.”

# My Favorite Handwritten Notes to VITO’s Personal Assistant
Building rapport with Tommie is absolutely critical if you expect to gain access to VITO. By including this personal note, you’ll be quietly and sincerely saluting Tommie’s uniform.

* “[Tommie], your guidance and insights into your enterprise are priceless. As you know, it’s so difficult to find a compassionate ear in our busy day and hectic schedules. I’ll look forward to our conversation on and finding out what you think about the enclosed correspondence. If you would like to change the time I’ve suggested, just give me a call.”
* “[Tommie], please take a look at this correspondence and let me know what your thoughts are about the proven ideas we have for the [hospitality] industry. If I’ve selected an inconvenient time for our first conversation, please let me know.”
* “[Tommie], we can actually deliver much, much more than is mentioned in this correspondence! So, if it’s okay with you, a quick conversation will help me get on the right track and stay there! If the time that I’ve selected isn’t convenient, please let me know.”
